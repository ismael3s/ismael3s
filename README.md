# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ismael Santana, a passionate full-stack software developer with a focus on backend development. In my free time, I enjoy reading about new technologies and exploring how they solve problems I've faced before. I see programming languages as tools and strive to use the right tool for day-to-day challenges.

I'm constantly challenging myself to create POCs using new technologies to understand their benefits and tradeoffs. As a result, I have experience with Elixir, Golang, Node.js, React, Next.js, Angular, C#, and a bit of Kotlin. I love simplicity when programming and deploying my applications, and I'm a fan of Docker, Mermaid, SQLite, software design, and functional programming.

## Hobbies

* Enjoy jumping rope
* Spending time with my girlfriend and my cat
* Reading on platforms like dev.to, Medium, and daily.dev
* Sometimes I like to play games
* Writing about what I'm learning using Markdown

## What I'm Learning / What I Want to Do

These days I'm learning about Phoenix LiveView and WebSockets, and I want to share what I've learned in a digital garden or on YouTube. To do that, I need to improve my English and communication skills.

## Fun Fact (Maybe?)

On every social network, I try to use **ismael3s** as my nickname because my complete name is Ismael Souza da Silva Santana :D
