# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ismael Santana, a passionate full-stack software developer with a focus on backend development. I've been working as a developer since 2021, and my journey into programming began in high school in 2016. I see programming languages as tools and strive to use the right one for daily challenges.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about new technologies and exploring how they can solve problems I've encountered. I constantly challenge myself to create POCs using new technologies to understand their benefits and tradeoffs. This has led me to gain experience with Elixir, Golang, Node.js, React, Next.js, RabbitMQ, Angular, and C# (.NET). I value simplicity in programming and deployment, and I'm a fan of Docker, Mermaid, SQLite, software design, and functional programming.

## Hobbies

* Jumping rope
* Spending time with my girlfriend and my cat
* Reading on platforms like dev.to, Medium, and daily.dev
* Occasionally playing games
* Writing about what I'm learning using Markdown

## What I'm Learning / What I Want to Do

Lately, I've been learning about .NET and Golang, and I plan to share my knowledge through a digital garden or on YouTube. To achieve this, I'm improving my English and communication skills.

## Fun Fact (Maybe?)

On every social network, I try to use **ismael3s** as my nickname because my full name is Ismael Souza da Silva Santana. ðŸ˜„
